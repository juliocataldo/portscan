**Python Port Scanner**

### Overview:
This Python Port Scanner is a simple yet powerful tool designed to scan ports on a target host or network. With this script, you can quickly identify open ports and potential vulnerabilities, enabling you to secure your systems more effectively.

### Features:
- **Port Scanning**: Scan ports on a specified host or range of hosts to identify open ports.
  
- **Customizable Options**: Configure the script to scan specific ports or ranges of ports, adjust timeout settings, and control the level of verbosity.

- **Multi-threading**: Utilize multi-threading to speed up the scanning process and handle multiple connections simultaneously.

### Usage:
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-port-scanner.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: 
   ```
   cd python-port-scanner
   ```

3. **Run the Script**: 
   ```
   python port_scanner.py <target_host> <start_port> <end_port>
   ```

   - Replace `<target_host>` with the IP address or hostname of the target host.
   - Specify the range of ports to scan by providing `<start_port>` and `<end_port>`.
   - Optionally, customize additional parameters such as timeout and verbosity level.

4. **Review Results**: Once the scan is complete, review the results to identify open ports on the target host.

### Example:
```
python port_scanner.py example.com 1 1000
```
